<h1>SOLID PRINCIPLE</h1>
Don't Dear to violate them 

<h3>SOLID stands for:</h3>
S - Single-responsiblity Principle<br>
O - Open-closed Principle<br>
L - Liskov Substitution Principle<br>
I - Interface Segregation Principle<br>
D - Dependency Inversion Principle<br>

<h2>SRP: The Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
<p>In the context of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) we define a responsibility to be
“a reason for change.” If you can think of more than one motive for changing a class, then
that class has more than one responsibility. This is sometimes hard to see. We are accustomed to thinking of responsibility in groups.</p>
<b>A CLASS SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE REASON TO CHANGE.</b><br>

<h1>OCP: Open-Closed Principle</h1>
<p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, components, etc.)
should be open for extension, but closed for
modifications.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons for closing modules against changes/
for making modules open for extension</strong><br>
• The module was delivered to customers and a change
will not be accepted. If you need to change something
later, hopefully you opened your module for extension!<br>
• The module is a third-party Library/Framework and only
available as binary code. If you need to change
something, hopefully the third-party opened the module
for extension!<br>
• Not having to change existing code means modular
compilation, testing and debugging.</p>
