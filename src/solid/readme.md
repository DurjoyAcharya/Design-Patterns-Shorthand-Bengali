<h2>SRP: The Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
<p>In the context of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) we define a responsibility to be
“a reason for change.” If you can think of more than one motive for changing a class, then
that class has more than one responsibility. This is sometimes hard to see. We are accustomed to thinking of responsibility in groups.</p>
<b>A CLASS SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE REASON TO CHANGE.</b><br>
